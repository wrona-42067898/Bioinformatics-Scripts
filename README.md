# Bioinformatics-Scripts
Outline of the scripts I wrote to process raw paired-end reads and call variants for the non-model organism Symbiodinium. Some quality control and exploratory data analysis is also included in the second notebook. Python, R, and Bash scripts were used throughout this project along with a large number of linux commandline tools for variant analysis.
